# Basic JavaScript slot machine
The aim of this project was to create a basic slot machine type game that a user could interact with by betting money and spinning the reels to try and win.
The game consists of 4 reels with various images of lego minifigures that are shuffled in a random order each time the reels are spun.

    ## UX

#### Project Goals

### User Goals

The aim of this project was to use JavaScript to make a site that a user could interact with. The final idea was to go with a basic slot machine style game that was easy for the user to use.

#### User Stories

The game starts with 100 dollars that the user has to bet with. The user has a choice of three different values in which they can bet; 1, 5, or 10 dollars. The higher the amount the user bets, the higher the reward if the user wins. A win is accomplished by matching images on the spinning reels.

### Design Choices
The design idea was to keep th.........................................


**icons**
- I made use of the large array of icons that font-awesome has to provide its a simple way of creating an effect to show what the site has to offer.
- i made use of the, Fork, Wine glass, Ship, Swimming pool & umbrella icons which i though was an effective way to show users that our site offers the relevent services.

**colors**
- Throughout the majority of my projec......................................

**styling**
- I opted for a basic navbar with three links to ensure the user does not get lost with too many options to venture off from.
- The background Image is of an aerial view of a city night sky with an Opaque overlay to reduce the intensity of the sharp city lights, I felt that it gives off a feeling or relaxtaion and calmness to the user when landing upon the page.
- I have made use of the boostrap grid system to create a less complex approach to relaying my content with in the site.

**logo**
- I once again obtained the logo as a font-awesome icon to ensure simplicity.
- I chose an aeroplane as i felt it suited the needs of a travel app within the right context.

## Features
### Existing Features
-The app uses the Google Maps and Google Places API to provide search results about accommodation, places of interest and places to eat. Each individual result may be added to a list below the map so user's can keep track of the places they wish to visit, stay or dine.

### Features left to implement 
-In the future, I would like users to be able to save the pdf file and share it through social media to enable friends and family to have a look at the itinerary for future purposes.

### How to Run Code Locally
In order to run a repository locally, the repository must be cloned. To clone the repository
:
1. Follow the link to the [interactive front end development project GitHub repository](https://github.com/...........................).
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository. 
4. In your preferred IDE, open the terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type ```git clone```, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

### Testing
-## Automated Testing

### Validation services
The following validation services and linter were used to check the validity of the website code.
- [W3C Markup Validation]( https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate HTML.
- [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate CSS.
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate JavaScript.

## Manual testing
Below is a detailed account of all the manual testing that has been done to confirm all areas of the site work as expected. 

### Testing undertaken on desktop and laptop

All steps on desktop were repeated in browsers: Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer and on two different desktop screen sizes.

1. Responsiveness
    - The results table sits alongside the map on larger devices as PC and laptop. 

### Testing undertaken on tablet and phone devices
All steps below were repeated to test mobile specific elements on the developers 2 Samsung phones and tablet. 
And also in the Chrome Developer Tools device simulators on all options and orientations.

1. Responsiveness
    - The results table is hidden and appears directly under the map only when the user selects the visit, stay or dine buttons.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) in Google Dev tools(Galaxy S5, Pixel 2/Pixel 2 XL, iphone 5/SE/6/7/8 Plus, X, ipad and ipad Pro) and on multiple devices.

## Further Testing

Family and friends were asked to try the app on their devices. This insight was invaluable for improving site usability.
